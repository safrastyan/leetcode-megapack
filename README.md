# 🚀 LeetCode Megapack Solutions

A comprehensive collection of LeetCode problems solved in multiple programming languages (Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, Go, and more). Each solution includes detailed explanations, time and space complexity analysis, and optimal approaches. Perfect for interview preparation at FAANG, MAANG, and other top tech companies.

I take credit for the synthesis, not for the source :)
